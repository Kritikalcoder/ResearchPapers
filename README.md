# Research Papers
A repository of all the research papers I read

## Sem 5  
1. Towards a formalization of Teamwork with Resource constraints (implementation)  
2. Constructing Optimal Policies for Agents with Constrained Architectures  
3. Coordinating occupant behavior for building energy and comfort management using multi-agent systems  
4. Towards adjustable autonomy for the real world  
5. An introduction to Reinforcement Learning (textbook)- Chapters 1-6  
6. Dynamic Multi Criteria Reinforcement Learning - (implementation)  
7. The Malmo Platform for Artificial Intelligence Experimentation - tool  
8. A Comprehensive Survey on Safe Reinforcement Learning - in brief  
9. HogRider: Champion Agent of Microsoft Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge (implementation)  
(more need to be added)  

Apart from these papers, I have also invested time in watching tutorials on RL and in general, developing a better understanding of RL, by looking at various other applications and papers. I haave also explored DQNs to a certain degree.
